# Content
This directory is used heavily based on the PNDM codebase. We use it to benchmark STORK-4 on CIFAR-10, LSUN-Bedroom, and flow-STORK-4 on MS-COCO datasets.

# Instruction
See `scripts` for sample code for FID calculations.
You should download the model checkpoints into `models`. Look for the checkpoints in the [Google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1leEpziaPdYlshzB4QALY5pL7Snw8XM28) by PNDM

# Set up environments
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
