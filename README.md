# STORK

# TODO

# Benchmarking CIFAR-10, LSUN-Bedroom, MS-COCO
We based off the PNDM codebase. See `external/PNDM`

Due to size limit, we delete the pre-computed FID stats and the metadata for coco. This will be available upon requests.

# Benchmarking MJHQ-30K
We based off the DPM-Solver codebase. See `external/Sana`
